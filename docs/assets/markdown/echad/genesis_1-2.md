## Contradictions

- Chapter 1 is poetic, chapter 2 is narrative.
- In chapter 2, man is created before vegitation and animals, contrary to chapter 1.
- God is ethereal in chapter 1, yet anthropomorphic in chapter 2.
    - God "planted" the Garden of Eden.
    - God speaks directly to Adam.
- Chapter 2 contains details about the creation of man and chapter 1 contains only a synopsis.
    - Possibly a contradiction between the creation of Adam and Eve vs. "them".
    - Chapter 1: order of creation of man vs woman is ambiguous.  Chapter 2: explicit.
