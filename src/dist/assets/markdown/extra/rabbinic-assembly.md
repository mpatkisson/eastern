> "The [Rabbinical Assembly](https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/) is the international association of Conservative rabbis. Since its founding in 1901, the Assembly has been the creative force shaping the ideology, programs, and practices of the Conservative movement, and is committed to building and strengthening the totality of Jewish life. The Assembly publishes learned texts, prayerbooks, and works of Jewish interest; and it administers the work of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards for the Conservative movement. It also serves the professional and personal needs of its membership through publications, conferences, and benefit programs, and it coordinates the Joint Placement Commission of the Conservative movement. Rabbis of the Assembly serve congregations throughout the world, and also work as educators, officers of communal service organizations, and college, hospital, and military chaplains."

## Organization and Philosophy

> "The Conservative movement is comprised of institutions including congregations, schools, camps and seminaries worldwide. The Rabbinical Assembly, the membership organization for Conservative rabbis has approximately 1,700 members who proudly serve the institutions of the movement, as well as the larger Jewish community. 
>
> The philosophy of the movement, as summarized by Rabbi Bradley Artson in a pamphlet entitled, "Conservative Judaism: Covenant and Commitment," is as follows: 
>
> It is precisely this traditional approach-which combines fidelity to inherited tradition and the courage to integrate necessary change-which motivates Conservative Judaism today. Whether asserting the equality of women, reaffirming the centrality of Shabbat (the Sabbath), kashrut (the dietary laws), tzedekah (charity/justice), and prayer, or applying timeless wisdom to contemporary issues, Conservative Judaism insists on observance of tradition and respect for visionary change. The Conservative Jewish community places its trust in its rabbis to be interpreters of halakhah and guides to Jewish life and learning. Each rabbi serves as halakhic authority for his or her community, and our rabbis collectively give direction through the Rabbinical Assembly."

## Committee on Jewish Law and Standards

> "The [Committee on Jewish Law and Standards](https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards) sets halakhic policy for Rabbinical Assembly rabbis and for the Conservative movement as a whole. Its membership consists of twenty-five rabbis who are voting-members, as well as five non-voting lay representatives of the United Synagogue and one non-voting cantor representing the Cantors' Assembly. The Committee discusses all questions of Jewish law that are posed by members of the Rabbinical Assembly or arms of the Conservative movement. When a question is placed on the agenda, individual members of the Committee will write teshuvot (responsa) which are discussed by the relevant subcommittees, and are then heard by the Committee, usually at two separate meetings. Papers are approved when a vote is taken with six or more members voting in favor of the paper. Approved teshuvot represent official halakhic positions of the Conservative movement. Rabbis have the authority, though, as marei d'atra, to consider the Committee's positions but make their own decisions as conditions warrant. Members of the Committee can also submit concurring or dissenting opinions that are attached to a decision, but do not carry official status.
> 
> When reviewing teshuvot, it is important to remember that each of these papers was written in response to a specific question posed by a Conservative rabbi. Questions about religious practice should be brought to your local Conservative rabbi. Each rabbi is the mara d'atra, or local religious decisor, of a particular community. While the teshuvot on this website provide an invaluable source of learning, they are not meant to, nor can they, substitute for the opinions of a local rabbi."
