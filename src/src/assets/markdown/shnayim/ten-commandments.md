### Fourth Commandment
| [Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0) | [Deuteronomy 5:12-15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| Remember the Sabbath day . . . you shall perform no labor, neither you, your son, your daughter, your manservant, your maidservant, your beast, nor your stranger who is in your cities. For [in] six days the L-rd made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the L-rd blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it | Keep the Sabbath day . . . you shall perform no labor, neither you, your son, your daughter, your manservant, your maidservant, your ox, your donkey, any of your livestock, nor the stranger who is within your cities, in order that your manservant and your maidservant may rest like you. And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the L-rd your G‑d took you out from there with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; therefore, the L-rd, your G‑d, commanded you to observe the Sabbath day. |

### Fifth Commandment
| [Exodus 20:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0) | [Deuteronomy 5:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| Honor your father and your mother, in order that your days be lengthened on the land that the L-rd, your G‑d, is giving you. | Honor your father and your mother as the L-rd your G‑d commanded you, in order that your days be lengthened, and that it may go well with you on the land that the L-rd, your G‑d, is giving you |

### Tenth Commandment
| [Exodus 20:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0) | [Deuteronomy 5:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey,  or anything that belongs to your neighbor | And you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor shall you desire your neighbor's house, his field, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor |

## Complication

These two accounts both refer to the same events at Mt Sinai but have significant
meaningful differences.  So how can both versions be true?

### Possible Resolution #1

One resolution to this anomoly comes from [Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4455092/jewish/Why-Two-Versions-of-the-Ten-Commandments.htm) who posits that the version in
Exodus was offered to the whole world while the version in Deuteronomy was given
to Israel.  Therefore, the latter version is more demanding.

### Possible Resolution #2

Our own theory on this topic suggests that ancient Israel had grown in faith during
its 40 year wilderness campaign.  This can be evidenced by the establishment of
a civic legal system as well as the building of a tabernacle.  Thus, when Moses
gives his final speech in Deuteronomy, 

- Moses was actually given the Deuteronomic version of the Decalogue.
- Upon witnessing the golden calf event Moses decides to present the less demanding version.
- Israel progresses, civically and spiritually during its 40 year campaign in the wilderness.
- Upon his departure in Deuteronomy, Moses is speaking to the next generation.
- Successive generations should improve within the community and with reverence to God.

## Takeaways

- People who enter the Sanaic Covenant are held to a higher standard.
- Successive generations should grow in Godliness.
