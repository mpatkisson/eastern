## How did Ruth become Jewish?

- **Determined pledge** to Naomi, the Hebrew People, and the Hebrew God.
- **Virtuous actions** were noticed by the people of Bethleham and Boaz in particular.
    - Stayed with Naomi rather than re-marrying.
    - Worked hard to bring food to Naomi.
    - Marriage proposal was to Boaz (Naomi's redeeming kinsman).  Ruth could have married someone younger.
      This act helped Naomi, not necessarily herself.
- **Public legal declaration in front of a quorum** took place when Boaz agreed to redeem the estate and via marriage.

### Redemption

- Ruth and the estate are redeemed by Boaz.
- Naomi is redeemed by Obed.
- The Jewish people are redeemed through the Davidic line.
- The world is redeemed through the messiah.

### Creation

- Obed is created
- More abstractly, this is the creation story for the Davidic monarchy as well as the messiah.  This may indicate why
  the story was cannonized.

### Revelation

This story reveals how someone not born Jewish can have an affect on the Jewish world and, through the messiah, the
world at large.
