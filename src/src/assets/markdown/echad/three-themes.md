## Franz Rosenzweig

A German born, Jewish theolgian, philosopher and translator who lived between 1886 and 1929.  Rosenzweig originally
entertained Christian theology as a young man, but became a [baal teshuva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_teshuva)
after attending [Yom Kippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur) services in Berlin. Rosenzweig's most notable
philosophical work is _The Star of Redemption_.

## The Star of Redemption

Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first published in 1921). It is a description of the relationships
between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a
diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map.
He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation
arises not in metaphysics but in the here and now. We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world,
and that is redemption.  ([Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Rosenzweig))
